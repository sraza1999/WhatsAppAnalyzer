# WhatsAppAnalyzer
### Download data from a specific WhatsApp chat (private or group!) and see your chats in a completely different light! 
Explore who had the most messages, the frequency of the messages, and many other different ways to look at your chats.
Here are some examples of the different graphs:

**HeatMap based on the number of messages per month for all the years**

**Word Cloud based on all messages, and User-based!**
